 # Transforming Code into Beautiful, Idiomatic Swift

Adapted to Swift from Raymond Hettinger's talk at pycon US 2013 by Paul Ossenbruggen https://github.com/possen [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=OSGv2VnC0go), [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/pyconslides/transforming-code-into-beautiful-idiomatic-python-by-raymond-hettinger-1).
Many of the nice idioms of Python are here in Swift and some are even nicer. Python idioms apply well to swift in most cases. Although, the types can add more verbosity.

The code examples and direct quotes are all from Raymond's talk where appropriate. If something does not make sense in Swift I deleted that section. I tried to stay close to the original examples, but in some cases added more where Swift has more alternatives.

}
//: ### closed range
for i in 0...5 {

//: ### Swift does not offer square of an integer, only the `Pow` function which takes Doubles. Another approach which is faster is to use the bit shift operator.
